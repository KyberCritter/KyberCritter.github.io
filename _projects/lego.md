## Overview

I design and build custom LEGO models. I include high-quality 3D renders and instructions.

## Project Highlights

### Custom Builds

- Designed and built original LEGO models
- Created professional instruction PDFs for each build
- Documented part lists and building techniques

### Design Approach

- Structural integrity and stability
- Aesthetic design and proportions
- Reproducible builds with clear instructions

## Tools & Process

- **Design**: Planning and prototyping custom models
- **Documentation**: Professional instruction PDFs
- **Parts Management**: BrickLink for sourcing specialty pieces

## Gallery

*Coming soon: Gallery of completed LEGO builds with instruction PDFs*
