## Overview

With {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" | minus: 2016 }}+ years of 3D printing experience, I design and manufacture functional parts, prototypes, and custom solutions using CAD modeling and 3D printing technology.

## Skills & Expertise

- **CAD Modeling**: SolidWorks for precision engineering design
- **3D Printing**: Maintenance, repair, and operation of FDM printers, SLA printers, binder jetting printers, and chemical baths
- **G-code/Cura Scripting**: Custom print profiles and automation
- **Materials**: PLA, PETG, ABS, resin, Kevlar, nylon, carbon fiber, powder, and chemical supports

## Project Highlights
