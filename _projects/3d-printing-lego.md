## Overview

With over 9 years of 3D printing experience, I combine CAD modeling, engineering principles, and creative design to create custom LEGO builds and functional 3D printed parts.

## Skills & Expertise

- **CAD Modeling**: SolidWorks for precision design
- **3D Printing**: FDM printing, printer maintenance, and optimization
- **G-code/Cura Scripting**: Custom print profiles and automation
- **LEGO Design**: Custom builds with instruction documentation

## Project Highlights

### LEGO Custom Builds
- Designed and built custom LEGO models
- Created professional instruction PDFs for reproducibility
- Combined traditional LEGO building with custom 3D printed elements

### 3D Printing Projects
- Functional parts for manufacturing applications
- Custom enclosures and prototypes
- Maintenance and calibration of FDM printers

### Engineering Support
- Former technical support specialist for UA College of Engineering
- Assisted students and faculty with 3D printing projects
- Maintained and troubleshot multiple 3D printer types

## Technical Experience

- **Software**: SolidWorks, Cura, PrusaSlicer
- **Hardware**: Various FDM printers, maintenance and repair
- **Materials**: PLA, PETG, ABS, and specialty filaments
- **Applications**: Functional prototypes, custom parts, artistic builds
