        <p>Here are some of my favorite projects. I've included a brief description of each project, and you can click the title to visit the project's webpage.</p>
        <div class="project">
            <h2><a href="conference_analysis.html">College Football Conference Analysis</a></h2>
            <p>As an avid college football fan, I'm disappointed by recent conference realignments. As a part of my <a href="https://github.com/KyberCritter/Pygskin">Pygskin project</a>, I used Python and data analysis techniques such as clustering and visualization to demonstrate the absurdity of conference geography in the 2023 football season.</p>

            <h2><a href="colley_rankings_index.html">College Football Computer Rankings</a></h2>
            <p>Another part of my <a href="https://github.com/KyberCritter/Pygskin">Pygskin project</a> involves implementing various computer ranking systems for college football teams. I started with the Colley Matrix, one of the original Bowl Championship Series (BCS) polls. I used this project as practice for API usage and data structure implementation.</p>

            <h2>Engineered Wood Products Manufacturing Scheduling Application</h2>
            <p>During my time at SmartLam North America, I've written a desktop app using Python and PyQt6. This application automatically generates production schedules for engineered wood products based on a customer's order. We use this tool to set up our production of hundreds of thousands of dollars of product weekly.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2><a href="identifymon.html">Image Classification with a Conventional Neural Network</a></h2>
            <p>I used my experience with machine learning to create an ML model to classify images as Pokemon or Digimon. I've converted the neural network to operate in a web browser using JavaScript, which is linked above. You can find more information in the <a href="https://github.com/KyberCritter/identifymon">Identifymon GitHub repository</a>.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Resume Conversion Software</h2>
            <p>I developed a simple app for SWJ Technology that converts Indeed-style resumes into the company's preferred Word format. The program is 90% accurate, which means users typically just need to edit down the amount of content included, making the contract worker hiring process very simple.</p>
