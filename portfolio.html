            <h3>Engineered Wood Products Manufacturing Scheduling Application</h3>
            <p>During my time at SmartLam North America, I've written a desktop app using Python and PyQt6. This application automatically generates production schedules for engineered wood products based on a customer's order. We use this tool to set up our production of hundreds of thousands of dollars of product weekly.</p>

            <h3>Image Classification with a Conventional Neural Network</h3>
            <p>I used my experience with machine learning to create an ML model to classify images as Pokemon or Digimon. You can find the web version <a href="identifymon.html">on this part of my website</a></p>
            <p>You can find more information <a href="https://github.com/KyberCritter/identifymon">at the Identifymon GitHub repository</a>.</p>

            <h3>Resume Conversion Software</h3>
            <p>I developed a simple app for SWJ Technology that converts Indeed-style resumes into the company's preferred Word format. The program is 90% accurate, which means users typically just need to edit down the amount of content included, making the contract worker hiring process very simple.</p>
