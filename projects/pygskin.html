        <h1>Pygskin</h1>
        <p>My college football analysis project, Pygskin, uses Python and the College Football Data API to rank teams, explain conference alignment, and more. You can find the source code in the <a href="https://github.com/KyberCritter/Pygskin">Pygskin repository</a>.</p>

            <h2><a href="/projects/conference_analysis_2024.html">College Football Conference Analysis</a></h2>
            <p>As an avid college football fan, I'm disappointed by recent conference realignments. I used Python and data analysis techniques such as clustering and visualization to demonstrate the absurdity of conference geography in the 2024 football season.</p>

            <h2><a href="/projects/colley_rankings_index.html">College Football Computer Rankings</a></h2>
            <p>Another part of the project involves implementing various computer ranking systems for college football teams. I started with the Colley Matrix, one of the original Bowl Championship Series (BCS) polls. I used this project as practice for API usage and data structure implementation.</p>
            <br>
            The Colley Matrix uses wins and losses to rank each college football team with respect to their strength of schedule. For a full explanation of the math behind the formula, visit <a href="https://www.colleyrankings.com/method.html">Colley's website</a>.
