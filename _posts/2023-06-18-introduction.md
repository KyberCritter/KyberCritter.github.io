# Purpose
Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Scott Ratchford, and I started this website in June of 2023 to build my personal brand and learn about web development. I plan to use this website to display my portfolio of work and post periodic writings.

# Sections
Currently, the site is split into the following sections.
## Home
This is the landing page. It provides a brief introduction to the website.
## Resume
This is a download link for my resume in PDF format.
## Social Media
This page links some of my social media accounts and my GitHub repositories.
## Sports
This page is an index of sports reviews for some games I watched. I do not have the time to write about every major game. I intend to post mostly reviews of Alabama football games, along with my highlighted games of the week.
## Articles
This page is an index of all non-sports writings posted to my website. Some may be media reviews, while others are more general.
## Minigames
I would like this page to provide an index of web-based minigames I create. Currently, the only game in working order is Snake, so I've set the button to redirect users there.
