Welcome back to [ScottRatchford.com](https://scottratchford.com)! It's been a while. I'm excited to relaunch my personal website. I've upgraded to Jekyll, a popular static site generator. It's made it simple to add project pages, a blog, and more.

## What's Next

If you know me, you know I love to talk about college football. I've been following the latest moves in conference realignment ([North Dakota State](https://themw.com/news/2026/02/09/mountain-west-adds-north-dakota-state-as-a-football-only-member/) and [Sacremento State](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/47933760/mac-add-sacramento-state-football-only-member)), and I'm plotting some analysis of my own. How do these moves compare to historical ones? What level of success should we expect from these new additions? Could NDSU sweep the conference in year one?
