*Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny* is the fifth and "final" movie in the classic adventure movie series. Much like the other two "final" movies in the series, the film focuses heavily on the legacy that people leave behind.

The film starts with a cold opening following Dr. Jones and a fellow professor of archeology as they attempt to retrieve artifacts from the Nazis in 1944. Later, we follow Indiana in the 1970s as he adventures with his antagonistic goddaughter (his coworker's daughter) and a child who plays the roles of this movie's Short Round.

All the actors in the movie put on good performances, but the side characters have little dialogue for their screen time. The movie is paint-by-the-numbers for an Indiana Jones film, but it suffices as a summer blockbuster. The visuals and action sequences are all well-crafted, but none are unique. The main problem with the movie is its lack of message. The film has nothing to say about being the "last" film in its franchise.

All in all, the movie is worth watching if you want a movie to simply sit back and relax with. The action is pleasing and the story is a fine execution of many common ideas and themes. Unless you're expecting high art, you won't be disappointed.
