# Where in the world is Scott Ratchford?
This week, I'm thousands of miles from home in beautiful Porto, Portugal!  I'm studying at the European Innovation Academy (EIA) alongside over 500 people from across the world. I'm working in a team of 5 to develop a business plan, conduct customer interviews, and pitch our idea to investors.

# Our week so far
## Day 0, July 16
On Day 0, everyone in EIA met for orientation and team recruitment. After a few hours, those of us with businesses we wanted to pitch wrote them on posters and stood them up in a common area. We spent 2 hours in the afternoon recruiting teammates, losing teammates, and finding new teammates. After team formation, we registered our team and headed home for the day.
