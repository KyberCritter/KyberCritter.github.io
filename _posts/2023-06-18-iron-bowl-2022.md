# Iron Bowl 2022
In my third year of college, I finally got to go to the Iron Bowl. After a disappointing season by Crimson Tide standards, Alabama looked to end the season on a high note. Auburn drew first blood, but the Tide replied with a resounding victory.

## 1st Quarter
Alabama 14, Auburn 7

## 2nd Quarter
Alabama 21, Auburn 7

## 3rd Quarter
Alabama 7, Auburn 7

## 4th Quarter
Alabama 7, Auburn 6

# Final
Alabama 49, Auburn 27
