# Review
We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie is a solid remaster of the original game. Minor technical issues, such as mid-level loading screens, take away from the pace of the game, but the overall experience remains intact. The levels are more varied than the original, including different objectives, such as maintaining a flame. However, some of these gimmicks are more frustrating than fun. Regardless, I would still recommend the game to anyone who enjoyed the original. It provides a solid entertainment value for the price, $30 at launch.
